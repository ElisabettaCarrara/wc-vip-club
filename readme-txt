== Configuration ==

**VIP Role Name**
Defines the display name of the VIP role (for example "VIP Customer" or "Gold Member").

**Advanced Role Slug Override**
Optional. If provided, this value will be used internally instead of automatically generating the slug from the role name. This is recommended for developers who want stable role identifiers.

**Spending Threshold**
The total lifetime amount a customer must spend to become a VIP.

**Customer Experience**

Customers will see a "VIP Club" tab in:

My Account > VIP Club

The page shows:
* Current progress toward VIP status
* Remaining amount needed to reach VIP
* Confirmation message once VIP status is achieved

**How VIP Status Is Assigned**

A customer is upgraded to VIP when:
* An order reaches the "Processing" or "Completed" status
* Total lifetime spending meets or exceeds the configured threshold
* The customer does not already have the VIP role

VIP status is not removed automatically.
